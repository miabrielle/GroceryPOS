Coding Standards

Classes
Use upper case letters as word separators in name, lower case for the rest of a word
First character in a name is upper case
No underbars ('_') in name
Should have separate header and implementation files

Methods
Capitalize the first letter of each word, make the rest lowercase
Name accurately describes purpose of method
One return per function

Variable Names
Lowercase first letter, capitalize the first letter of each following word
Variables (outside loops) cannot be a single letter

Global Constants
Capitalize all letters with underscores separating words
Global constants are used for any constant value whose value is known to the programmer that is used throughout the program

Commenting
Every separate page or file has at least 2 lines explaining the overall purpose the page
Comments are spread through the program explaining the purpose of each major block of code or explaining the thought process of any major algorithm









Agile Stories

Story #1

Description:
As a store manager, I want to be able to display a sales report for any given day, so that I can estimate inventory.

Priority: Sprint #1
Assignee: Mia

List of tasks and tests
list of items and quantities sold
names of the members who shopped that day
total revenue for the day
number of executive and regular members shopped that day
an option to generate the display by member type

Definition of Done:
When the software can print out an accurate report and can handle errors without interrupting the program.

Story #2

Description:
As a store manager, I should be able to display the total purchases for all members sorted by membership number. The display should also have the grand total of purchases, so that I can easily rank customers by membership.

Priority: Sprint #1
Assignee: Connor

List of tasks and tests:
display total purchases for all members
add functionality to sort purchases by membership number
add a grand total of purchases

Definition of Done:
This story is done when the list is correctly sorted by membership number, and when the correct number of purchases is displayed with the corresponding member. It should also sum all of the member's purchases into a grand total.

Story #3
Description:
As a store manager, I should be able to display the quantity of each item sold sorted by item name and the total revenue for each item, so that I can easily sort items by the amount of times that item has sold, as well the total revenue that item has made.

Priority: Sprint #1
Assignee: Jordan

List of tasks and tests:
display the quantity of each item sold
sort each item by item name and total revenue generated by said item
test to make sure items are sorted by ascending or descending item name (choose one or make both options available)

Definition of Done:
The store manager can easily display the quantity of each item sold in the database. The store manager should also be able to sort each item by item name (ascending/descending) as well as the total revenue generated by each item.
This functionality should be able to handle any run-time errors that the user may present to it.

Story #4
Description:
As a store manager, I should be able to display the rebate of all the Executive members sorted by membership number, so that I can accurately and easily generate a report of how much money each member should be rebated.

Priority: Sprint #1
Assignee: Issac

List of tasks and tests:
display the exact rebate amount of all Executive members in the database
sort rebate amounts by membership number

Definition of Done:
This story is done when the store manager can easily generate a list of all executive members sorted by membership number and their corresponding rebate amount.

Story #5
Description:
As a store manager, I should be able to enter a month and obtain a display of all members whose memberships expire that month as well as the cost to renew their memberships, so that I can notify members of their expiring membership in order to maximize company revenue.

Priority: Sprint #1
Assignee: Mia

List of tasks and tests:
prompt store manager for month input
display all members whose memberships are expiring on given month
display the cost to renew said member's memberships

Definition of Done:
This story is done when the store manager can easily input a month and be given a detailed list of all members whose memberships are expiring on the given month, as well as the cost to renew their memberships.

Story #6
Description:
As a store manager, I should be able to enter an item name and display the quantity of that item sold as well as the total revenue for the item.

Priority: Sprint #2
Assignee: Jordan

List of Tasks and Tests:
enter an item and search a list for it
once found, display the name along with the quantity and amount sold

Definition of Done:
Successfully take user input and display the correct number of items sold and the correct total revenue for that item.

Story #7
Description:
As an administrator, I should be able to add/delete Bulk Club members so that in any case a new members can join, membership expiration, or membership cancellation. Your team should provide the capability to create purchases for the new members to validate your software.

Priority: Sprint #2
Assignee: Connor

List of tasks and tests:
Create new member
Save ALL club members
Delete a member
Save the data of the deleted member
Only Administrators my access

Definition of Done:
Can create and save new members, can delete existing members and save their info.

As a store manager, the program should be able to determine if any Regular customer should convert their membership to Executive status or Executive members should return to Regular status in order to enhance the customers experience.

Priority: Sprint #2
Assignee: Issac

List of tasks and tests:
write the algorithm to determine when someone would financially benefit from moving to the next membership tier or lower level
graphical user interface interacts well with the user and organized well
handles errors such as improper input
can run continuously to check many members without user entering each input

Definition of Done:
The program is done when the user can use the program easily and has an accurate response. The program should be able to handle errors such as improper input

Story #9

Description:
As a store manager, I should be able to enter a membership number or name and display the total purchases for that member.

Priority: Sprint #2
Assignee: Mia

Achieve the same outcome with member names

Definition of Done:
Be able to search a list of club members with a name or club number and display the total purchases for that member.


Story #10

Description:
As a store manager, the program should require the store manager and administrator to logon to obtain access to your program so that the program is safe from outside sources .

Priority: Sprint #2

List of tasks and tests:
create a repository of login credentials including login and password that should pass the program
make a graphic interface that will allow the manager to login
write a program that will check logon information against existing credentials

Definition of Done:
This story is done when an administrator can add or delete an item, with a corresponding price, from the inventory list.


Story #12

Description:
As a program user, the program should save information between each execution so that it is continually usable by the store

Priority: Sprint #3
Assignee: Issac

List of tasks and tests:
create functionality across the entire program that will save information between executions

Definition of Done:
The program can close and open while saving the information from previous runs.
